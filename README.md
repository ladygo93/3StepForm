To run APP download gitHub repo to your OS.
Open file directory in terminal and run following commands `npm install` following by `npm start`
App should start automatically in your default Browser.

Note. You must have Node.js globaly installed on your OS before so you would have access to `npm` terminal commands
To check if you have `node` installed on your OS run following in terminal `node -v`
Use `https://nodejs.org/en/` and download LTS version if you need.

Please see comments in `Form` Component about `HTTP` request and how I would do that.
